## NUCLEO_G474RE_FW_Study

This repository contains my personal learning notes and code from the Udemy courses “Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)” and “Advanced Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™”, which were originally taught in C.  
I have converted the course content into both C and C++ versions, based on the NUCLEO-G474RE board.  
The development tools used are STM32CubeMX and CLion.
